I would like to remove my need for stow. This likely means writing a script that does it's job using unix/posix compliant utilities.

something like:

cp-rsf <from-dir> <to-dir>
r = recursive, create directories for each file
s = create symlinks instead of copying
f = overwrite previously existing files/symlinks
