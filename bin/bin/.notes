to some extent these scripts will always be system dependent but I would like to decouple them from the specific OS if I can. I think if I have an alias or variable that allows me to abstract away the specific package manager I can get much closer to that goal though it still assumes a format of <pm> install <package> which may not hold true, expecially for flags like "-y" (yes to all install questions). I may be better off making OS specific scripts and labeling them as such. Maybe put them in OS specific folders.
