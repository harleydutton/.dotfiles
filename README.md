## todo
- I would like scrolling through history to be sorted based on what I have already typed
- I would like a shortcut in vim to comment/uncomment multiple lines I have selected "v" mode
- Have setup.sh install most of the shit I always want.
- probably remove the readme because I'm going to start cloning this into my home folder
