# dotfiles


this repo contains my dotfiles. i have just gotten around to cleansing my vimrc and now i want to sync it with my phone. 

when possible each dotfile will have its own TODO. more general TODO's will appear here.

i should make and update my bashrc. i should ask marco for hiw bashrc as a starting point.

this is a test of the credential cacheing for git
