## Setup Script

Prerecs: bash, git, ssh
untested: best to run line-by-line

``` bash
cd ~ \
git clone https://github.com/harleydutton/.dotfiles.git \
./.dotfiles/bin/dir-ln.sh ~/.dotfiles ~ ".*(/\.git/|README\.md|root).*" \
ssh-keygen.sh \
```

### notes
- tell zsh to start in a toolbox most of the time
- remove ads from mom's tablet
- get zsh to stop being annoying when using arrow keys
